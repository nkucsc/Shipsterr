#Prototype- Shipsterr-Master 
#Class: CMPS-115

#Project description
Shipsterr is a shipping calculator that allows the user to get shipping rates from multiple service providers. Our website is easy to use and asks the user for zipcode, city, and state the user is shipping from as well as to and length of the package, width of the package, height of the package, and service type. The calculator then returns estimates on rates based on these inputs of three of the biggest domestic service providers: UPS, USPS, and FedEx. Ideally this project should be hosted on a web server with Node.js installed.

## How to use:

1. Download and unzip the file "Shipsterr-Master".
3. Download and install Node.js (a simple and lightweight javascript runtime).
4. Once Node.js is installed, open the command terminal of your computer and move inside the "Shipsterr-Master" directory.
5. Type "npm install" (without quotations). This installs the required node modules.
6. Once installation is complete, type "node server.js".
7. Open a web browser, and enter localhost:8080/ into the URL. This should take you to the homepage of the website.
8. Click on the calculator button and enter the desired length, width, weight, and to: and from: locations. Make sure to pick a service type (ground shipping, 1 day, or 2 day).
9. Click the submit button at the bottom, and the website will take you to a new page with the prices of FedEx, UPS, and USPS based on your inputs. If you entered something incorrectly, invalidly, or did not enter anything at all, error messages describing what is missing will show on this page instead of prices.
